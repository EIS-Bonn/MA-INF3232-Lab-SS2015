    <h2>
        Welcome to Govt. Data Analysis and Visualisation 1.0
    </h2>
    <p>Here you will Analysis and Visualize graphically as well as in tabular form how fast Population of Germany, United Kingdome and France increase or decreases
     and what is the Population density, growth rate, birthrate and death rate of specified countries and how dynamically it goes up or low every year. All of this data
     is available on the particular country’s official Govt. data portal.</p>
    <h2>Population</h2>
    <p>The total number of persons inhabiting a country, city, or any district or area</p>
    <h2> Population Density</h2>
    <p>Number of people per square kilometeror per unit Area</p>
    <h2> Growth Rate %</h2>
    <p>The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving 
    a country. The rate may be positive or negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of
     its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen 
     as threatening by neighboring countries.</p>
    <h2> Birth Rate (Birth/1000 Population) </h2>
    <p>This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is
     usually the dominant factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility and the age structure of the population.</p>
     <h2> Death Rate (Death/1000 Population)</h2>
    <p>This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death rate, while only a
     rough indicator of the mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly affected
      by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all ages, as declining fertility
      results in an aging population.</p>
